                      Django includes an admin page serving as a service desk,
                      aiding users in managing safety concerns and sensitive
                      deletions. Built on Django's Rest Framework and JWT
                      authentication, the platform ensures secure user access.
                      Unauthorized users are restricted from modifying records,
                      with data isolation preventing users from accessing other
                      family's information. ORM, Python's automated and
                      performance test (Locust) guarantee smooth performance
                      under high user loads while minimize errors.

            Similar to viewing individual member's record, it is also possible

            BEAUTY here is that the family net income is calculated down below
            and can be filtered by entering years and months. Just start by
            appending the base url by
            <a class="link--secondary">tracker/families/::family_id/records/</a>

              IMPORTANT: Again, all the info related to family or individual
              earnings, expense, and the net are hidden from people who have not
              linked themselves to your family. Don't worry about the security
              issue as we have taken care of that for you.
